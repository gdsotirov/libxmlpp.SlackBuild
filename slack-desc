libxml++: libxml++ (A C++ wrapper for the libxml XML parser)
libxml++:
libxml++: Libxml++ is a C++ wrapper for the libxml2 XML parser library
libxml++: (otherwise known as the GNOME XML library).  It has SAX and
libxml++: DOM-like APIs, but does not attempt to conform exactly to
libxml++: the DOM specification because they are not aimed at C++.  Its
libxml++: API is much simpler than the underlying libxml C API.
